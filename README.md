# Team Page Generator

## Description
My objective was to develop an automated tool capable of generating an HTML file containing a team's details based on user input. This project was designed to enable me to generate a concise HTML file containing pertinent information regarding my team. The application eliminates the need to consider the structure and styling of HTML. It has come to my attention that node.js is an indispensable automation tool and that it is extremely potent. My project distinguishes itself by producing a presentable HTML page in a timely manner with minimal exertion.
